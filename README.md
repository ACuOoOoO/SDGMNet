# SDGMNet
SDGMNet models in Pytorch for paper ["SDGMNet: Statistic-based Dynamic Gradient
Modulation for Local Descriptor Learning"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04434).

# Training Code
Coming soon.

# Pre-trained models
Pre-trained models and loggers on UBC PhotoTour can be found in [pretrained](pretrained).

# Losses
We implement several state-of-the-art [losses](losses.py) including [SOSNet](https://github.com/yuruntian/SOSNet) and [HyNet](https://github.com/yuruntian/HyNet#hynet-learning-local-descriptor-with-hybrid-similarity-measure-and-triplet-loss). Our noval loss will be released later.
